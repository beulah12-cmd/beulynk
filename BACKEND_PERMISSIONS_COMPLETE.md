# ✅ Django Backend API Permissions Updated

## 🎯 Summary

The Beulynk Django backend API permissions have been updated to enforce proper user-level data access control.

---

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. **Updated REST Framework Settings** (`blynk_backend/blynk_backend/settings.py`)

**Changed:**
```python
'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': [
    'rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticated',
],
```

**Before:** `IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly` (allowed anonymous read access)  
**After:** `IsAuthenticated` (requires authentication for all endpoints by default)

---

## 🔒 Current Permissions by Endpoint

### **Public Endpoints** (AllowAny)
- ✅ `POST /api/auth/register/` - User registration
- ✅ `POST /api/auth/login/` - User authentication  
- ✅ `GET /api/ngo-info/` - NGO information

### **Protected Endpoints** (Require Authentication)
- 🔒 `POST /api/auth/logout/` - User logout
- 🔒 `GET /api/auth/profile/` - Get user profile
- 🔒 `GET /api/volunteer/` - List user's volunteer requests
- 🔒 `POST /api/volunteer/` - Create volunteer request
- 🔒 `GET /api/donor/` - List user's donor requests
- 🔒 `POST /api/donor/` - Create donor request
- 🔒 `GET /api/help-request/` - List user's help requests
- 🔒 `POST /api/help-request/` - Create help request
- ✅ `POST /api/contact/` - Submit contact message (still AllowAny)

---

## 🛡️ Security Features Implemented

### **User-Level Filtering**

All request endpoints already filter data by `request.user`:

```python
# In views.py
def get(self, request):
    requests = VolunteerRequest.objects.filter(user=request.user)
    # Users only see their own requests
    
def post(self, request):
    serializer.save(user=request.user)
    # Requests are automatically assigned to the logged-in user
```

### **Automatic User Assignment**

When creating requests, the user is automatically set:
- `VolunteerRequest` → assigned to `request.user`
- `DonorRequest` → assigned to `request.user`
- `HelpRequest` → assigned to `request.user`
- `ContactMessage` → no user assignment (anonymous allowed)

---

## ✅ Verification

### **Test Authentication Requirements**

1. **Try accessing protected endpoints without authentication:**
   ```bash
   curl https://beulynk-backend.onrender.com/api/volunteer/
   # Should return 401 Unauthorized
   ```

2. **Try accessing with authentication:**
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_TOKEN" https://beulynk-backend.onrender.com/api/volunteer/
   # Should return only the logged-in user's requests
   ```

3. **Test user isolation:**
   - Login as User A → submit volunteer request
   - Login as User B → submit volunteer request
   - Verify User A only sees their own requests

---

## 🔄 Next Steps for Render

Since the settings changed, you need to redeploy the backend:

1. **The settings.py change is already pushed to GitHub**

2. **Render should auto-deploy** (if connected to GitHub)

3. **Or manually trigger deployment:**
   - Go to https://dashboard.render.com
   - Open `beulynk-backend` service
   - Click "Manual Deploy" → "Clear build cache & deploy"

---

## 📝 Note on Contact Endpoint

The `/api/contact/` endpoint is intentionally left as `AllowAny` because:
- Contact forms should be accessible without login
- Anyone should be able to send messages
- No sensitive user data is collected

If you want to change this, update `api/views.py`:

```python
class ContactMessageView(APIView):
    permission_classes = [permissions.IsAuthenticated]  # Add this if needed
```

---

## ✅ **Status: COMPLETE**

**The Django backend now enforces proper authentication and user-level data filtering.**

- ✅ Default permission set to `IsAuthenticated`
- ✅ Users can only see their own data
- ✅ Automatic user assignment on request creation
- ✅ Anonymous users blocked from protected endpoints
- ✅ Changes pushed to GitHub and ready for deployment

---

**Updated:** Settings now require authentication by default, ensuring secure access to all user data endpoints.
